A CLI to create standard basic Components or Services for your React projects

## Available Scripts

In your project's package.json, add a script task with any name you want, then give it the command *generator*.

Now, you can run your task to start using the CLI.

e.g. 
`"scripts": {
    "mytask": "generator
  }
`

`npm run mytask`
